## Bank_Finace_Project
#  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to uncover lending trends, borrower behavior, regional patterns, and overall loan performance. The analysis distinguishes between **Good Loans** and **Bad Loans**, helping banks make **data-driven decisions** for loan approvals and risk management.

The project demonstrates **end-to-end data analytics**, starting from SQL-based data analysis to interactive Power BI dashboards.

# Project Objectives
- Provide a **holistic view** of the bank’s loan portfolio
- Identify trends in **loan applications, funding, and repayments**
- Evaluate the bank’s **financial health** using KPIs
- Support **strategic decision-making** in credit and loan offerings

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements

- **Total Loan Applications**  
  Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period, including Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

- **Total Funded Amount**  
  Understand the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, monitor MTD Total Funded Amount, and analyze MoM changes.

- **Total Amount Received**  
  Track the total amount received from borrowers to assess cash flow and loan repayment, including MTD Total Amount Received and MoM changes.

- **Average Interest Rate**  
  Calculate the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitor MoM variations.

- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**  
  Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers, compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track MoM fluctuations.

  Summary Visualization:
