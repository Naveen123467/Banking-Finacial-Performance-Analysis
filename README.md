# Project : Banking Finacial Performance Analysis  
# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to uncover lending trends, borrower behavior, regional patterns, and overall loan performance. The analysis distinguishes between **Good Loans** and **Bad Loans**, helping banks make **data-driven decisions** for loan approvals and risk management.

The project demonstrates **end-to-end data analytics**, starting from SQL-based data analysis to interactive Power BI dashboards.

# Project Objectives
- Provide a **holistic view** of the bank’s loan portfolio
- Identify trends in **loan applications, funding, and repayments**
- Evaluate the bank’s **financial health** using KPIs
- Support **strategic decision-making** in credit and loan offerings

 # Skills Demonstrated
- Banking & Financial Data Analysis
- SQL Querying & KPI Calculation
- DAX (MTD, MoM, Averages, Ratios)
- Power BI Dashboard Design
- Data Cleaning & Validation
- Business Insights & Risk Analysis

# Dashboard 1: Summary

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements

- **Total Loan Applications**  
  Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period, including Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

- **Total Funded Amount**  
  Understand the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, monitor MTD Total Funded Amount, and analyze MoM changes.

- **Total Amount Received**  
  Track the total amount received from borrowers to assess cash flow and loan repayment, including MTD Total Amount Received and MoM changes.

- **Average Interest Rate**  
  Calculate the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitor MoM variations.

- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**  
  Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers, compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track MoM fluctuations.

  Summary Visualization:
Loan Status Grid View: Gain a comprehensive overview of lending operations and monitor loan performance categorized by 'Loan Status'. This grid view provides insights into metrics such as Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, MTD Funded Amount, MTD Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average DTI.
